<p>A simple webpage designed with collaboration from Jesse Blahnik, Jacob Maschka, and Samuel Aleks.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project was done to fulfill class requirements for the final project in CS 344 (Introduction to Web Programming) at Winona State University in Spring, 2023, under the professorship of Daniel Nash. The entire development took place in pure CSS+HTML with no assistance from any external frameworks.</p>
<h2>Hosting</h2>
<p>The website was initially hosted on a VPS provided by Hostinger, running Apache. Website HTTPS certification was achieved using certbot. Renewal of the certification was accomplished by creating a monthly cronjob. UFW was used as a firewall to prevent unneseccary ports from being opened.</p>
