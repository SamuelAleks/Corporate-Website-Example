<h4>Authorship</h4>
<p>A simple website designed with collaboration from Jesse Blahnik, Jacob Maschka, and Samuel Aleks.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project was done to fulfill class requirements for the final project in CS 344 (Introduction to Web Programming) at Winona State University in Spring, 2023, under the professorship of Daniel Nash. The core prompt of the project was to develop a website, centered around a business, that would inform employees on a specific topic; markedly, our topic was that of Coporate Environmentalism. The entire development took place in pure CSS+HTML with no assistance from any external frameworks. In addition to the implemention of components of CSS and HTML that were taught and learned in the process of the course, care was taken to account for accessibility needs when developing the site. Major changes following an accessibility check included changing the justified text to left-aligned, and adding descriptive alt-text to images.</p>
<h2>Hosting</h2>
<p>The website was initially hosted on a VPS provided by Hostinger, running Apache. Website HTTPS certification was achieved using certbot for the domain name "samaleks.com" (no personal gain intended, domain used out of availability, all group members retain equal credit for the project). Renewal of the certification was accomplished by creating a monthly cronjob. UFW was used as a firewall to prevent unneseccary ports from being opened.</p>
